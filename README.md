# ApologyVideoGenerator

A problem our generation faces is the need to apologize for the horrible things we have done.
Youtube sensations do so many horrible things, and apologize in such a generic and uniform way, the apology video has become its own 'unqiue' genre (I say 'unque' because these videos are all practically the same)

In order to maximize efficiency, a combination of sad videos with a text to speech function could easily generate these videos, saving precious time.

To that end, this program aims to automate the creation of Apology vidoes, and it achieves its purpose!




In addition to requirements.txt, ffmpeg must be installed on your computer for this program to function
